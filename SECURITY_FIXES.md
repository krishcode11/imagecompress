# üîí Security Fixes and Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines all security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed in the ImageCompressor project, along with ongoing security best practices.

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Security Issues**

### 1. **Exposed Credentials**
- **Issue**: Firebase service account private key was hardcoded in `server/firebase-service-account.json`
- **Fix**: Replaced with placeholder values and added environment variable validation
- **Action Required**: Set `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`, etc. in `.env` file

### 2. **Hardcoded API Keys**
- **Issue**: CoinPayments API keys were hardcoded in the source code
- **Fix**: Moved to environment variables with validation
- **Action Required**: Set `COINPAYMENTS_PUBLIC_KEY` and `COINPAYMENTS_PRIVATE_KEY` in `.env` file

### 3. **Missing Security Headers**
- **Issue**: No security headers were configured
- **Fix**: Added Helmet middleware with comprehensive CSP and security headers
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 4. **No Rate Limiting**
- **Issue**: API endpoints had no rate limiting protection
- **Fix**: Added express-rate-limit with 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 5. **Weak Session Security**
- **Issue**: Weak session configuration and no validation
- **Fix**: Added strong session secret validation, secure cookies, and custom session name
- **Action Required**: Set a strong `SESSION_SECRET` in `.env` file

### 6. **No Input Validation**
- **Issue**: API endpoints accepted any input without validation
- **Fix**: Added Zod schemas for all API inputs with sanitization
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 7. **Missing CORS Protection**
- **Issue**: No CORS configuration
- **Fix**: Added CORS middleware with proper origin validation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 8. **No WebSocket Security**
- **Issue**: WebSocket connections had no rate limiting
- **Fix**: Added connection rate limiting (max 5 connections per IP)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 9. **Weak Error Handling**
- **Issue**: Internal errors were exposed to clients
- **Fix**: Added proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

### 10. **Missing File Upload Validation**
- **Issue**: No validation for file uploads
- **Fix**: Added file type, size, and content validation
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Implemented

## üîß **Required Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Required for production
SESSION_SECRET=your-very-long-random-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=your-neon-database-url

# Firebase Configuration (optional - will use development mode if not set)
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your-firebase-private-key
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-firebase-client-email
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id

# CoinPayments Configuration (optional - payments won't work if not set)
COINPAYMENTS_PUBLIC_KEY=your-coinpayments-public-key
COINPAYMENTS_PRIVATE_KEY=your-coinpayments-private-key

# Optional Configuration
NODE_ENV=production
BASE_URL=https://your-domain.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-domain.com,https://www.your-domain.com
```

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Best Practices**

### 1. **Environment Variables**
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, random secrets for `SESSION_SECRET`
- Rotate API keys regularly

### 2. **Database Security**
- Use connection pooling
- Implement proper backup strategies
- Use read-only database users where possible

### 3. **API Security**
- Monitor rate limiting logs
- Implement API versioning
- Add request logging for security analysis

### 4. **File Upload Security**
- Validate file types server-side
- Scan uploaded files for malware
- Store files outside web root

### 5. **Authentication**
- Implement proper session management
- Add two-factor authentication for admin accounts
- Log authentication attempts

### 6. **Payment Security**
- Validate webhook signatures
- Implement idempotency for payments
- Monitor for suspicious payment patterns

## üîç **Security Monitoring**

### 1. **Log Analysis**
Monitor these logs for security issues:
- Authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- File upload patterns
- Payment webhook activity

### 2. **Regular Security Audits**
- Review access logs monthly
- Check for suspicious IP addresses
- Monitor for unusual API usage patterns

### 3. **Dependency Updates**
- Keep all dependencies updated
- Use `npm audit` regularly
- Monitor security advisories

## üö® **Emergency Response**

### 1. **If Credentials are Compromised**
1. Immediately rotate all API keys
2. Revoke and regenerate session secrets
3. Check logs for unauthorized access
4. Notify users if necessary

### 2. **If Database is Compromised**
1. Take database offline
2. Restore from clean backup
3. Reset all user passwords
4. Investigate breach vector

### 3. **If Payment System is Compromised**
1. Disable payment processing
2. Contact CoinPayments support
3. Review all recent transactions
4. Implement additional fraud detection

## üìã **Security Checklist**

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Rate limiting is active
- [ ] File upload validation is working
- [ ] Payment webhook validation is working
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak information
- [ ] All dependencies are updated
- [ ] Security monitoring is in place
